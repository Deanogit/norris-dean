# OPAL Strategy

## Orientation

### Define the task and identify its purpose:

- what are you hoping to achieve?
- Rephrase the brief so it makes sense to you
- check you understand fully what is required

### Clarify the desired end point:

- What precisely will indicate that you have accomplished what you set out to do?

### Estimate the scale of the task:

- Is it easy or will it take a lot of planning, time and/or resources?
- Where are you now?
- How far is that from your desired end point or outcomes?

### Decide your route:

- Identify the steps (or at least the next step) from where you are now to where you are now to where you need to be.
- If you are not clear of your route - 7 steps / Project reports resources

### Identify potential options:

- Consider whether there is another way of thinking about the task.
- What might be an alternative way of achieving the desired end point?
- How many possible solutions can you generate in order to give yourself options on a way forward?

### Consider resources:

- What would you need to get the job done?
- Are such resources going to be available?
- Include:
- Time?
- Advice?
- Learning materials?
- Specialist space?
- Participants?

### What expertise can you bring to bear?

- You might find it helpful
